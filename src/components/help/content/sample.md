##Currently, you can see the Sample World only if you run the Namespace Browser on your local machine. See $V23_ROOT/release/projects/browser/README.md

##If you run the hosted version (https://browser.v.io) you will not see the Sample World. This issue will be fixed in the near future. See https://github.com/vanadium/browser/issues/64 for more information.

Sample World is a sample namespace that allows you to experiment
with the Namespace Browser:

You can browse through the Sample World namespace, and call methods.

The Sample World represents two homes, called "house" and "cottage",
which both contain home automation to turn lights on and off,
arm and disarm alarms, play music, water the lawn, check the
smoke alarms, and feed the pet. The included (robotic) pet tests
your ability to keep it well fed and happy.
