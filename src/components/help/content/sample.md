To enable the Sample World demo, visit [/#/demo](/#/demo) or pick
"Sample World Demo" from the side navigation menu.

You can browse through the Sample World namespace, and call methods.

The Sample World represents two homes, called "house" and "cottage",
which both contain home automation to turn lights on and off,
arm and disarm alarms, play music, water the lawn, check the
smoke alarms, and feed the pet. The included (robotic) pet tests
your ability to keep it well fed and happy.
